# 1. Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

## GIF Image

In 1984 after reading in a magazine article about an efficient lossless compression algorithm called LMZ, developers at CompuServe released the GIF image. The developers did not know that the algorithm had a patent pending. The GIF image become popular for efficiency and transformed the web in later years to colour. Unisys in 1986 successfully patented the algorithm but didn’t stop CompuServe. The two companies, a few years later, joined together and ordered that developers need to pay for the use of the format. Now the format is used all across the WWW and is a non-paid format.

## World Wide Web

In 1990 the internet took on a recognizable form when the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee (an engineer and computer scientist from Great Britain). The World Wide Web is confused with the internet however the web allowed means to access data through the form of hyperlinks and websites. This was a crucial step in developing the vast trove of information we all know today.

## Browsers

The big start for the WWW was when the browser was available for download. Some of the browsers avail were Erwise, Viola and Arena. However the first to gain popularity was Mosaic, developed by a student of Illinois University in 1993. This caused growth in WWW and interest in websites. Currently there are many browsers available.

## Hotmail

Hotmail was born in 1995, conceptualised by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith. Hotmail was the first major web-based email provider was launched in 1995 then bought in 1997 by Microsoft for \$400m. This was a milestone in communication technology, any user can send to any user on a networked computer.

## Email storage

In 2004 Hotmail offered a tiny 2MB of email storage while Yahoo offered 4MB. Google however announced it was launching their email service with 1GB of storage. This sparked a shift in the email world. Now web-based providers offer gigabytes of storage as standard in their free email system.

# 2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- Packets - A packet is the unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the Internet or any other packet-switched network.
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) - An IP address (internet protocol address) is a numerical representation that uniquely identifies a specific interface on the network. Addresses in IPv4 are 32-bits. Addresses in IPv6 have a size of 128 bits.
- Routers and routing - A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks and routing is the process of transmitting and routing IP packets over the Internet between two or more nodes.
- Domains and DNS - Domain names are used to identify one or more IP addresses and DNS short for Domain Name System (or Service or Server), an Internet service that translates domain names into IP addresses.

# Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

- Packets - Packets contributed to the development of the internet for their ability to break down pieces of information, like an email, into chunks of efficient size for routing and send them through to the destination. Then the email is reassembled at the destination. A packet is used to send information efficient and reliably so data doesn’t need to be sent in a single large file. The packet also has an error checking system. If the packet doesn’t match, the packet can be resent.
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) contributed to the development of the internet as they serve two main functions. It identifies the host or the network interface then establishes the path or route to get there. The header of the IP packet contains the IP address of the sending host and the destination host.
- Routers and routing - Routers and routing contributed to the development of the internet as they form the route between the host and the destination. A networking device known as a router sends data packets between computer networks. The routing is the process is selecting a path for the packets in between a network or multiple networks.
- Domains and DNS - Domains as the domain name is an identifier string that directs to an administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet. DNS contributed to the development of the internet as domain names are made following the rules and procedures of the DNS. All names registered in the DNS is a domain name.

# 3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- TCP - Transmission Control protocol or TCP is a standard which defines establishing and maintaining a network conversation to exchange data through application programs. The TCP and IP work together to define how computers send packets of data. TCP and IP form the basic rules defining the internet. 
TCP is a connection-orientated protocol, meaning a connection is established the maintained until the application programs completed their exchange. TCP dictates how to break data into packets so networks can deliver, send and accept the packets, TCP also manages the flow. The packets error handling is also through the TCP, it handles the retransmission of dropped or jumbled packets as well as the acknowledgement of the arrival of all the packets complete and error free. 

- HTTP and HTTPS - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol or HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the WWW. This protocol decides how messages are formatted and transmitted. The HTTP also defines what actions web servers and browsers should do in response to various commands. This method focuses on how the information is presented but doesn’t address how it gets from A to B. This method can potentially be intercepted and manipulated by 3rd parties. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is much like HTTP. It is a younger, more secure protocol. It is an encrypted connection and uses Secure Sockets Layer or SSL to transport the data safely. It is used for secure communication over computer networks. This protocol is very widely used on the internet. SSL doesn’t have anything to do with the way the data is displayed only how the data is transferred from A to B. 

- Web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools) - A web browser or more commonly known as a browser is an application for accessing the WWW. A web page, image or video are individually identified by a Uniform Resource Locator or URL. This enables the browser to retrieve the resource from a server, return and display on the users device. 
An information request is made from a client to a server over HTTP. This request is made for a webpage, data, text, image or video then uses HTTP. The server responds with the data and it is sent to the client and displayed on their device. 
Rending on a web browser is typically specified by CSS or Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a set of rules that the browser interprets. These rules specify details such as fonts, colour, text sizes and layouts. The browser gathers all the specified rules to calculate where visual element coordinates then will render this to the screen. Some browsers may being the rendering process before the pages resources are fully downloaded. When the browser displays in this order it can cause visual changes as the rest of the data is received as well as an un-styled page then changes to styled when the data is received. 
Developer tools in browsers do a range of tasks. The tools include inspecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They also can view page request and how long it took to load. Modern browsers include these powerful developer tools and are extremely useful in web development 


# Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet 

- TCP - TCP has contributed to the development in client and server communication by the use and flow of packets. An example of the client and server interaction is the HTML page or website. The server sends the HTML file to a client, the HTTP asks the TCP to set up the connection then send the file. The TCP divides the file into chunks/packets, numbers and organises the packets and then sends them through while error checking and retransmitting if needed then at the end acknowledges all packets have been received in the correct way. 
- HTTP and HTTPS - HTTP and HTTPS as well as SSL technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet due to its options for unsecured HTTP for static sites and the option of HTTPS secured with SSL for websites that require security. Both HTTP and HTTPS are both focused how messages are formatted and transmitted as well as what actions web servers and browsers should do in response to various commands
- Web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools) - Web browser technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet by enabling the client to request by URL, HTTP then processes the request, retrieves and returns the data to the client’s device. This makes the websites created highly accessible. 
The rendering process through the CSS file rules create interesting and dynamic websites which is visually pleasing to the client. 
The use of development tools within the browser are extremely useful for developers. They allow developers to view load times and run audits on the webpages. This can help create useful and swift loading webpages. The developer tools also allows the developer to run the webpage on simulated devices which is useful when there is many devices in the market. 


# 4. Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

- Hashes - Hashes store data like a dictionary (word and definition). The word is known as a key and definition as known as a value. This data structure is useful for mapping words to definitions, names to phone numbers. You can call the key, value individually or call both and iterate though them. 
- Arrays - Arrays use a chunk of memory that can expand and compact depending on the amount of elements being stored. Objects are stored in an array one after another. An array can be used as a base for more complex data structures and arrays can be created to collect results from running a loop. Arrays can also be split to separate elements. 
- Stacks - Stacks in Ruby work like a stack of plates. When you stack plates, you can only take the top plate, not the middle or bottom. They store data in a last in, first out order. This data structure can replace recursive methods and are great to manage instruction sequences by keeping track of what is left to do.

# 5. Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

Interpreter is a program that executes instructions written in a high-level language. High level languages are written in a way that is closer to human language. An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form, which it then executes. 

In contrast, a compiler translates high-level instructions directly into machine language. Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted programs. The advantage of an interpreter, however, is that it does not need to go through the compilation stage during which machine instructions are generated. This process can be time-consuming if the program is long. 

An interpreter can immediately execute high-level programs. For this reason, interpreters are sometimes used during the development of a program, when a programmer wants to add small sections at a time and test them quickly. In addition, interpreters are often used in education because they allow students to program interactively.

# 6. Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

## JavaScript 

PROS\
JavaScript is an interpreted language, it can reduces the time required by other languages for compilation. This language also is a client-side script, speeding up execution and time to connect to the server. 
JavaScript is reasonable easy to understand and learn. The structure is simple for both developers and users. The language is also simple to implement saving developers to develop content for the web.
All modern browsers support JavaScript so it widely used and popular. Many companies use JavaScript as a tool. 

CONS\
JavaScript code is viewable to the user therefore others can use it for malicious purposes, such as using source code without authentication or place code within the site that could compromise the security of data. 
Even though JavaScript is supported by all modern browsers, browsers can interpret the language differently. The code needs to be tested on various browsers before publication. Also older browsers don’t support some of the new features so they also need to be tested. 
JavaScript debugging editors are not as efficient as other editors. The browser also doesn’t show any errors so it can be difficult to find problems and potential issues. 

## Python

PROS\
Python is widely used in the gaming, web frameworks and applications, language development, prototyping, graphics applications. 
Python provides an extensive standard libraries that include chain operations, the Internet, web service tools, operating system interfaces, and protocols. They also include support libraries and proprietary object-oriented designs. Many popular tasks are pre-programmed and reduces the amount of code written in Python and speeds up the programmer’s productivity. 
Python has control capabilities because it can call directly via C, C++ or Java. It can also process XML and other markup languages via the same byte code. Python integrates enterprise application integration allows the development of web services calling COM or COBRA components. With this powerful process integration, unit test frameworks and control capabilities help speed up applications and improve the application productivity.

CONS\
Python while popular and have various advantageous features, the language has not found its place in the Enterprise Development Shops.
Python has many support features and extensive libraries, programmers can find the change to other languages without the level of support Python offers to be difficult. 
Python is used in many areas of development in desktop and server platforms, mobile computing is a weak point for the language. Python is dynamically typed,mobile developers report many design restrictions.
An interpreter is used for Python instead of a compiler, which slows down own because compiling and running help it run smoothly. In web applications it is fast. 

# 7. Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.
## IP, Copyright and Acknowledgement
An IT professional is responsible for intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement. Web design is a common place to find this. IP or Intellectual Property can easily be infringed upon. It is important to include easily accessible sections that state the terms and conditions of use of the data whether it be text, images, and video. It is also important as a developer to check the materials you use and make sure you are not infringing on others IP. In web design the developer needs to set the terms of use for the webpage. This could include making your webpage content free for educational purposes (limited copyright). The client is then able to use the content for an educational class. Some content is able to be fully copied for free (no copyright) with no restrictions. It is important to decide how you want your content to be copyrighted and check the webpages you use are suitable for the use you are intending. Acknowledgement on the web is about giving credit to the author/owner of a particular resource. As a developer it can be difficult to know if acknowledgement is due. LoremPixel, a stock image site gives royalty free images for use without restriction. This site also offers the author/owner if you would like to give acknowledgment but it is not required. It is important to know where the images, quotes and videos you use require credit to the author/owner if you intend to use them.
## Legal
https://www.smartcopying.edu.au/\
This site while intended for School and higher education students lists topics related to copyright, licensing and general how to use copyright. The smart copy site while not directly related with the Australian Copyright Law or Australian Government Copyright Council is a useful resource regarding copyright set in a simple and easy to follow language. 
https://www.copyright.org.au/acc_prod/ACC/Information_Sheets/An_Introduction_to_Copyright_in_Australia.aspx\
If a more formal copyright was sought, the ACC has an introduction to copyright. It’s a small document that discusses the main points to know regarding copyright such as what does copyright protect, who owns the copyright, how and when to use the ‘copyright notice’ and symbol among other copyright points.
## Case Study
Authentic Design Alliance\
CASE STUDY The Problem With Copyright – Don’t Assume You’re Covered!\
28/10/2018\
 https://authenticdesignalliance.org/copyright-what-is-the-problem/\
Some of Australia’s best-known rock photographers are calling copyright infringement by the online auction of media giant Fairfax’s Sydney Morning Herald image archive.On Friday ABC news reported hundreds of original photographs that include Michael Hutchence and Kylie Minogue, Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil and many more iconic Australian and international rock musicians - are being sold online through Lawsons Auction house.Long story short – in 2013 Fairfax outsourced digitising their image archive to a US company that went broke and 2 million prints from the Sydney Morning Herald fell into the hands of the LA art dealer who has subsequently put them on sale in Australia.Finding multiple copies of their work in the auction, photographers took to Facebook with a string of WTF comments. Legends Tony Mott and Ian Greene claim in the thread they not only retain the negatives to the images, but still own copyright.

In this case the photographers most likely had an agreement (though copyright still belongs with the photographer) with Fairfax for use of their images. When Fairfax outsourced the digitising of their image archive to an overseas company. Fairfax extended the extended the agreement with the photographers, whether they were aware of this is unknown. When the overseas company when broke, an LA art dealer acquired the photographs. This is where the case gets tricky. The LA Art dealer may have paid the now broke company, this company didn’t have the right to. The photographers of the images still own them, whether they are sold or not. The dealer was also republished the images without photographer permission and were not credited or acknowledged. Photography in Australia is automatically protected. Currently images after 1955 are protected by copyright for the life of the creator plus an additional 50 years.
Ethical IT professions should in this case give credit to the photographer if permission is given to use the images, if permission is not given, it cannot be used. They are also responsible for informing the photographer of changes such as the extension to an overseas digitizing company and they should be able to withdraw the permissions if wanted. The overseas company is also in breach as they sold images to the LA art dealer without permissions and the breach falls on the art dealer for republishing. 

## GPS TRACKING
The Global Positioning System or GPS is a navigation system that allows land, sea and airborne users to determine exact positioning, speed and time anywhere in the world through the use of satellites. GPS can be used for varying situations. These include GPS directions through Google maps, tracking police cars and fitness and medical devices. The information regarding the current location speed and time zone can be a helpful resource and these are often sent to other parties to gain information, improve products. This information can also be used for malicious purposes. This is where the ethics of GPS arise. As an IT professional you need to be aware of what information is being collected and how it is being used. GPS tracking can show a great deal about a person. It can easily be seen that a person’s privacy becomes compromised, outweighing the benefits. The clients GPS data should be used in a way that complies with protecting their privacy. This data must be protected from other parties with malicious intent. This personal data should only be shared with the acknowledgement and approval of the client. 
## Legal

http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/wsa2005245/\
While Queensland has not specific GPS tracking laws (currently using Australian Surveillance Laws) and has become a new issue that many are confused about, NSW has laws regarding GPS tracking in the workplace, but still mainly use the Australian Surveillance Laws. These law related information resources are unfortunately not overly useful as an IT professional working with clients private GPS tracking data. There are not set rules but as a IT professional you would protect the data from malicious parties and only give data in the case of full approval and acknowledgement.

# 8. Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language
In Ruby there is a set of keywords called conditionals. Conditionals execute a certain statement under a certain condition. Loops are blocks of code that can be executed multiple times. These loops are executed from top then line by line until it gets to the bottom of the block. Ruby also provides statements to change the flow in an application. Statements are executed one after the other until the condition returns true then the code is terminated.  
Break statement – In Ruby the break statement is used to exit a loop when the condition is returned as true. Break is used within the loops. Break statements can be used in for and while loops as well as in case.


# 9. Explain type coercion
Type coercion is changing an objects type into another. These can easily help us transform one type to another. This could be changing an integer into another type such as a float in the case of a price (integer could be 3 and we want to make it 3.00, this would be coerced to a float. This can be achieved though helpers in Ruby. Some common type coercion used in Ruby are to string - .to_s, to integer- .to_i, to float- .to_f.

# 10. Explain data types, using examples
Ruby has many data types including string, Boolean, hash and number. As Ruby is an Object-Ordinated language data types are based on classes. \
Number – In Ruby a number is a series of digits. Number can be used with a decimal place by using a dot (4.68). Numbers can be both inerter and float. \
Boolean – This data type can only represent either true or false.\
String – Strings are groupings of letters forming sentence or words. Strings are encased in either single quotes (‘ ‘) or double quotes (“ “).\
Hashes – Hashes are a key and value set. A value can be assigned to a key using a rocket (=>) or a colon (:). A key and a value are separated by a comma and then encased in curly brackets ({ }).\

# 11. Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”
## Classes
MenuItems - To initalize the items and the prices\
Menu - Store the menu items into an array, to get prices for each item, list the names for each item\
Order - To initalize the hash to store the customers order\
Cafe - To create a new order, welcome the customer to the cafe, print available items with name and price, get the customers order, take the customers order, add to customers order, give total for the order\


# 12. Identify and explain the error in the code that is preventing correct execution of the program (100 words)
## Original
celsius = gets\
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32\
print "The result is: "\
print fahrenheit\
puts "."\
## Altered
celsius = gets.to_i\
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32\
puts "The result is: #{fahrenheit}."\

The original solution is incorrect as the gets input was not coming in as integer and the calculation can only be executed on numbers, either integer or float. The data type is incorrect and the gets input needed to be coerced to an integer for the code to run without error. The code for the message to the terminal could also be condensed in a single puts statement using interpolation between the double quote string.    

# 13. The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.
## Original

	i = i + 1 end\
puts i\
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]\
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]\
## Amended
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]\
i = 0\
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])\
